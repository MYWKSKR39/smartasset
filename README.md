SmartAsset: A Web-Based IT Asset Management System with AI
Chatbot Support

SmartAsset is a web-based asset management system developed to support the IT
department in efficiently managing IT equipment such as laptops, tablets, monitors,
or phones deployed across multiple bus interchanges. The system replaces
traditional paper and spreadsheet-based methods by offering a centralised, real-time
platform to track asset details, monitor usage, and streamline maintenance activities.
The core of the system is a structured relational database that stores comprehensive
records for each asset, including its type, serial number, assigned user, interchange
location, purchase date, status, and maintenance history. It supports two types of
users: Administrators, who have full control over asset registration, updates, and
maintenance tracking, and Users, such as bus captains or interchange staff, who
can check their assigned assets and report issues directly from the platform.
The SmartAsset interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, making it accessible
even to older bus captains or staff members who may have limited computer skills.
The layout uses clear text, minimal navigation steps, and straightforward forms to
help users interact with the system without confusion. This focus on usability ensures
that staff at all levels can participate in maintaining up-to-date and accurate asset
records.
To further enhance ease of use, the system features an AI-powered chatbot that
allows users to interact with the platform through natural language. Built using
natural language processing tools such as Dialogflow or OpenAI APIs, the chatbot
can answer queries like “What devices are assigned to me?” or “How do I report a
faulty monitor?” and guide users step by step. It simplifies routine tasks like issue
reporting or asset lookups without requiring users to manually navigate the interface.
By making asset management more accessible and efficient, SmartAsset helps
improve asset accountability, reduce downtime, and support faster issue resolution
across all bus interchanges. It ensures that devices critical to daily operations are
properly tracked and maintained, while also lowering the burden on administrative
teams.
This project demonstrates how practical web technologies and artificial intelligence
can be combined to create an inclusive, scalable solution for IT asset tracking in the
public transport industry, with special attention to user-friendliness for a diverse
workforce.
